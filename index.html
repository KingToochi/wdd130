                Hello, I’m Toochukwu Kingsley Umoke, born on May 22, 1996. I am a passionate learner and a driven individual committed to personal and professional growth<br />
                I earned my first degree in Microbiology in 2017, a field that sparked my curiosity about life sciences and the microscopic world. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in scientific research, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.<br>
                Currently, I am a student at BYU Pathway, where I am continuing my educational journey and exploring new avenues of learning. This program has given me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and further develop the skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to my community and the world.<br>
                I am excited about the future and look forward to the opportunities that will allow me to make an impact in both my professional and personal life.
